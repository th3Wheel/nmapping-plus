# Installation Requirements

This document lists the minimum and recommended system and software requirements for nMapping+.

## Supported Host Platforms

- Proxmox VE: 7.0+ (recommended 8.0+ for production)
- Host OS: Debian 11+ (or the OS supported by Proxmox VE version in use)

## Minimum Hardware

- CPU: 2 cores
- RAM: 4 GB available for containers
- Disk: 20 GB free space (SSD recommended)
- Network: Internet access for package downloads

## Recommended Hardware (Production)

- CPU: 4+ cores
- RAM: 8+ GB
- Disk: 50 GB+ (SSD) with separate volume for database and logs
- Network: Dedicated VLAN for monitoring/scanning traffic

## Required Software (container / app)

- Python: 3.9+
- SQLite: 3.35+ (WAL mode recommended)
- Nmap: latest stable (for scanning functionality)
- Node.js / npm: only if building front-end assets locally (version 16+ recommended)
- Git: for change tracking and synchronization between containers

## Network & Ports

- Allow outbound package download (HTTP/HTTPS) for installer and updates
- Web dashboard default port (adjust as configured): 80/443 (HTTP/HTTPS)
- If using WebSocket, ensure the chosen port is open between dashboard and backend
- Ensure scanning is permitted on target networks and configure firewall rules to avoid scanning management networks

## Configuration & Permissions

- Run containers with necessary capabilities for network scanning where required
- Ensure Nmap has sufficient privileges (capabilities or root) where needed
- Create a non-root application user inside containers for running services where possible
- Backup strategy for SQLite WAL and database files (regular snapshots)

## Additional Notes

- Obtain authorization before scanning networksâ€”adhere to applicable law and organizational policy
- For high-availability or larger deployments consider moving from SQLite to a client-server RDBMS (Postgres recommended)
- Keep software up to date for security (OS packages, Python dependencies, Nmap)
