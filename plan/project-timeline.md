## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Scanner implementation takes longer than estimated | High | Medium | Start early, parallel work on data format | Dev Lead |
| Testing reveals fundamental design issues | High | Low | Incremental testing, early validation | QA Lead |
| Nmap integration more complex than expected | Medium | Medium | Research early, prototype scanner | Developer |
| Performance issues with large networks | Medium | Low | Load testing in Phase 8 | Developer |
| Security vulnerabilities discovered late | High | Low | Security review in Phase 12 | Security |
| Deployment scripts fail on various configs | Medium | Medium | Test on multiple Proxmox versions | DevOps |

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Early Validation**: Test critical components early (scanner, data format)
2. **Parallel Work**: Database and data format can proceed in parallel
3. **Incremental Testing**: Test each phase before moving to next
4. **Documentation As You Go**: Update docs with each feature
5. **Security First**: Include security considerations in every phase
