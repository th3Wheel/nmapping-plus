# feature-nmapping-implementation-1

Short description
A top-level implementation plan for the nMapping+ feature set. This document groups phase plans (foundation, core features, integrations, etc.) and provides navigation to phase-specific task files.

Status: Draft  
Owner: Development Team

Phases
* Phase 01 — Foundation & Core Dependencies  
  * Link: ./tasks/phase-01-foundation-tasks.md

* Phase 02 — Core Scanner & Data Model (placeholder)
* Phase 03 — Dashboard UI & Websocket Integration (placeholder)
* Phase 04 — Agents Framework & Automation (placeholder)

Notes
* This file is intentionally minimal — expand each phase section with objectives, timelines, and acceptance criteria as work progresses.
* Use the tasks/ directory for phase-specific task documents (like phase-01-foundation-tasks.md).
